## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Modules
- **`app/main.py`** - FastAPI application with endpoints
- **`app/schemas.py`** - Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **`app/geocode.py`** - Census Geocoder integration
- **`app/geometry.py`** - UTM projection and grid cell creation
- **`app/tigerweb.py`** - TIGERweb integration for Census Block Groups
- **`app/census_api.py`** - Census Data API client with batching
- **`app/lodes.py`** - LODES WAC data integration
- **`app/aggregation.py`** - Area-weighted aggregation utilities

### Key Features Implemented

#### ✅ Geocoding
- Census Geocoder integration with retry logic
- Support for both address and lat/lon inputs
- Robust error handling for invalid addresses

#### ✅ Spatial Analysis
- Accurate 1km grid cell creation using UTM projection
- UTM zone detection based on coordinates
- Polygon area calculations in square kilometers

#### ✅ Census Data Integration
- TIGERweb queries for Census Block Groups
- Spatial intersection with area-weighted calculations
- Census Data API client with variable batching (≤50 per request)
- Support for ACS 5-year estimates (2010-2023)

#### ✅ Data Aggregation
- Area-weighted interpolation from Block Groups
- Comprehensive metrics calculation:
  - Population demographics (age distribution)
  - Household characteristics
  - Income brackets and median calculation
  - Employment statistics
  - Education levels
  - Housing stock and tenure
  - Cost and value metrics

#### ✅ LODES Integration
- Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) data
- Earnings bands and NAICS sector breakdown
- Caching system for downloaded data
- Spatial filtering by block GEOIDs

#### ✅ Production Features
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Input validation with Pydantic V2
- CORS middleware for web integration
- Health check and version endpoints

## 📊 API Endpoints

### `/grid_stats` (POST)
Main endpoint that accepts:
- `address` OR (`lat`, `lon`) coordinates
- `cell_km` (grid size, default 1.0)
- `acs_year` (data year, default 2023)
- `include_lodes` (workplace data, default false)

Returns comprehensive statistics in the exact schema specified.

### `/health` (GET)
Health check endpoint for monitoring.

### `/version` (GET)
API version information.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
- **33 tests passing** with comprehensive coverage
- Unit tests for core functionality:
  - UTM zone detection and CRS creation
  - Grid cell creation and area calculations
  - Area-weighted aggregation algorithms
  - Census API client functionality
  - Input validation and error handling

### Test Categories
- `test_geometry.py` - Spatial utilities
- `test_aggregation.py` - Data aggregation
- `test_census_api.py` - API client
